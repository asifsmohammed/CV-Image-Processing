# CV-ImageProcessing
Each program takes an input image in sRGB and converts the specified window over the image in to different color spaces using one of the 3 algorithms Linear Scaling, OpenCV Histogram Equalization, and Histogram Euqlization which is built from scratch. The output color spaces are Luv, Lab, xyz.
